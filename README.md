# Blueprint-webapp

This project includes a collection of [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com) components for you to use, and for us to showcase the capabilities of Codux.

Use this example to get a feel for how easy and fun it is to create and edit components in Codux that are based on 3rd party component libraries.

## Getting Started

Install the latest version of the Codux desktop application to get started. Refer [here](https://codux.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/kb14826) for prerequisites and setup instructions.

After installing the desktop application, have a look at [adding a GitHub project](https://codux.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/kb15627) to see how to clone a project from Codux. Use this URL for the repo to clone: **`https://github.com/codux-demos/blueprint-webapp/`**

Once youâ€™ve cloned the project, just run the installation script when prompted (see [Understanding Project Scripts](https://codux.wixanswers.com/kb/en/article/kb19225)). The project will be ready for you to use after you restart Codux.
